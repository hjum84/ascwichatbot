To investigate the association between housing insecurity and union dissolution among low-income parents with young children, we used a discrete-time event history analysis implemented through logistic regression models. This approach is well-suited for analyzing the timing and occurrence of events like union dissolution, as it accommodates both time-invariant and time-varying covariates while effectively managing right-censoring for unions that remain intact beyond the observation period. Leveraging the longitudinal structure of the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Studie (FFCWS), this method allows as to examine the dynamic relationship between housing insecurity and union stability over time, providing a robust framework to assess how economic stressors shape family outcomes. 
	The analysis is based on a person-month dataset constructed from the FFCWS, where each row represents a single month for each family, starting at the child’s birth and continuing until either union dissolution occurs or the observation is censored at the final interview wave (year 15). Union dissolution, the focal event, is recorded in the month it occurs, as reported by the mother during survey interviews at baseline, year 1, year 3, year 5, year 9, and year 15. For families whose unions persist through the study’s end, observations are right-censored at the last wave. This person-month structure enables us to model the conditional probability of dissolution in each month, given that the union has survived up to that point, aligning with the temporal focus of our research question.
	A key strength of this study is its incorporation of time-varying covariates, which are essential for capturing the evolving circumstances of families across the 15-year observation period. Time-varying covariates are updated at each survey wave using the interview month and year as a reference for the actual time of data collection. For each month in the person-month dataset, these covariate values are assigned based on the most recent wave predicting that month, ensuring that conditions reflect the family circumstances prior to the month under analysis. This lagging approach preserves temporal precedence, mitigating concerns about reverse causality. 
	The logistic regression model used in this discrete-time event history analysis estimates the monthly probability of union dissolution, conditional on survival to that month. The model is specified as follow: 
log(P_it/(1-P_it ))=α+β_1  ln⁡〖(t)_i 〗+β_2 〖Housing Insecurity〗_(i,w(t))+γX_i+δZ_(i,w(t))+θ〖City〗_i+ε_it
	In this equation, P_it represents the probability of union dissolution for family i in month t. The term ln(t), the natural logarithm of time since the child’s birth, serves as the baseline hazard, flexibly capturing the duration dependence of dissolution risk. Because covariates in the FFCWS are measured at discrete survey waves rather than every month, we introduce the notation w(t) to denote the wave associated with the most recent interview prior to month t. Thus, 〖Housing Insecurity〗_(i,w(t))  and  Z_(i,w(t))represent housing insecurity and other time-varying measures from the wave immediately preceding month t. This notation clarifies that we do not literally use the prior month’s data (which may not exist), but rather the last available wave. By assigning covariate values based on the wave nearest in time before month t, we measure temporal precedence, thereby mitigating concerns of reverse causality: the measured housing insecurity (or other covariates) reflects conditions that occurred before any dissolution event in month t. Time-variant covariates (X_i), such as demographic characteristics, remain constant and thus have no monthly subscript, which 〖City〗_i captures city fixed effects. The error term ε_it is assumed to be independently and identically distributed. In addition, robust standard errors clustered at the family level are employed to account for the correlation of observations within families over time (Wooldridge, 2010). 
	To investigate potential heterogeneity in the association between housing insecurity and union dissolution, we employed interaction terms across multiple model specifications. These moderation analyses examine whether the magnitude and significance of housing insecurity effects are contingent upon three distinct contextual dimensions: (1) private/informal support mechanisms, including financial transfers from family networks and co-residential arrangements; (2) public assistance program participation, encompassing TANF, SNAP, and unemployment insurance benefits; and (3) the local policy context, characterized by whether the state had a minimum wage exceeding the federal standard and whether it provided a supplemental Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) benefits. These moderation analyses provide insights into whether social or policy supports mitigate the adverse effects of housing insecurity on the likelihood of union dissolution. 
Missing data in the covariates posed a potential challenge to the analysis, which we addressed using Multiple Imputations by Changed Equations (MICE). This method is well-suited for handling complex patterns of missingness and preserves the integrity of the longitudinal dataset (Azur et al., 2011). We generated five imputed datasets and combined the results using Rubin’s rules to produce unbiased parameter estimates and standard errors that account for imputation uncertainty (Rubin, 2018). All statical analyses were conducted using Stata 15.1.
