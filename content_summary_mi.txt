*What is Motivational Interviewing?
Motivational Interviewing is a collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change. It is designed to strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the person's own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion.

*Core Principles of MI
1. Express empathy through reflective listening
2. Develop discrepancy between clients' goals or values and their current behavior
3. Avoid argument and direct confrontation
4. Adjust to client resistance rather than opposing it directly
5. Support self-efficacy and optimism

*MI Spirit
1. Partnership: Working in collaboration with the client
2. Acceptance: Respecting the client's autonomy, providing accurate empathy
3. Compassion: Promoting the client's welfare and prioritizing their needs
4. Evocation: Drawing out the client's own motivations for change

*OARS Skills
1. Open-ended questions: Questions that cannot be answered with yes/no
2. Affirmations: Statements that recognize client strengths and efforts
3. Reflective listening: Responding to what the client says by reflecting back meaning
4. Summarizing: Pulling together what has been discussed

*Change Talk vs. Sustain Talk
- Change Talk: Client statements that favor movement in the direction of change
- Sustain Talk: Client statements that favor maintaining the status quo

*Types of Change Talk (DARN-CAT)
- Desire: Wanting change ("I want to...")
- Ability: Perceived capability to change ("I can...")
- Reasons: Specific arguments for change ("If I change, then...")
- Need: Feeling obliged to change ("I need to...")
- Commitment: Promising to change ("I will...")
- Activation: Taking preliminary steps ("I'm ready to...")
- Taking steps: Reporting recent specific actions toward change ("I started...")

*Four Processes in MI
1. Engaging: Establishing a helpful connection and working relationship
2. Focusing: Developing and maintaining a specific direction in the conversation about change
3. Evoking: Eliciting the client's own motivations for change
4. Planning: Developing commitment to change and a specific plan of action

*Responding to Resistance
1. Simple reflection: Simply repeat or rephrase what the client said
2. Amplified reflection: Reflect back in an exaggerated or amplified form
3. Double-sided reflection: Reflect both sides of ambivalence
4. Shifting focus: Change the subject to shift away from resistance
5. Reframing: Offer a different perspective

*Rolling with Resistance
- Avoid arguing for change
- Resistance is a signal to respond differently
- Invite new perspectives, don't impose them
- The client is the primary resource for finding answers and solutions

*MI in Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice

*Example MI Questions and Statements
- "What concerns do you have about your current situation?"
- "What would you like to see different about your current situation?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how important is it for you to make this change?"
- "Tell me about a time when you were able to overcome a difficult challenge."
- "It sounds like you have mixed feelings about making this change."
- "What do you think would be the benefits of making this change?"
- "What might be some next steps that would work for you?"

*Ethical Considerations in MI
- Respecting autonomy while addressing mandated changes
- Balancing MI approach with child safety concerns
- Recognizing cultural variations in communication styles
